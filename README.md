# winIsActiveIP

*This is a horrible name for a command.*

This utility just checks which of the network devices on the machine are being used by DNS to address the system.

This is helpful in the event that you're sharing a Windows system and you want to tinker with some network devices, and you don't want to interrupt other people's work. This makes the assumption that they're doing their remote connection via the DNS name, though.

Actually, this tool makes a lot of assumptions. Oh well!
